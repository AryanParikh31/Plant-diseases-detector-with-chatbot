Plant Disease Detection System 🌱📸
This project is a Deep Learning and Machine Learning-based system developed using:

🐍 Django Framework (Python)
🗂️ XAMPP MySQL for database management
📦 Pre-trained model in .h5 format for disease prediction
📥 Model Setup
Unzip the model.zip file.
Move the .h5 file to the root folder (same directory as manage.py), instead of placing it in the model folder.
🚀 Features
✅ Upload leaf image for disease detection
✅ Deep learning model predicts the disease
✅ Displays disease description and possible solutions

📚 How It Works
Upload the image of the leaf.
The system processes the image and predicts the disease using a pre-trained model.
The result, including disease details and treatment suggestions, is displayed.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Django (Python)
TensorFlow / Keras (.h5 model)
MySQL (XAMPP)
